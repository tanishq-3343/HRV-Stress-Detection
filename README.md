## 🔬 Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis to detect physiological stress states from ECG recordings. It covers the full pipeline:

1. **Signal Acquisition** — ECG download from PhysioNet via `wfdb`, R-peak detection, RR-interval extraction
2. **HRV Feature Engineering** — 10 HRV features (time-domain, frequency-domain, nonlinear)
3. **Exploratory Analysis** — Tachograms, Power Spectral Density, Poincaré plots, rolling HRV
4. **Statistical Analysis** — ANOVA, Tukey HSD, Mann-Whitney U, Cohen's d across age groups and genders
5. **Time-Series Modelling** — AR(2) baseline, then full ARIMA with AIC/BIC grid search, residual diagnostics (Ljung-Box)
6. **Classification** — Rule-based autonomic state classifier + 2-layer LSTM with demographic features
7. **Feature Importance** — Random Forest permutation importance
8. **Evaluation** — Baseline (Eval 1) vs full multi-subject model (Eval 2) comparison

## 🏆 Key Results

| Metric | Eval 1 (Baseline) | Eval 2 (Full Model) |
|--------|:-----------------:|:-------------------:|
| Subjects | 1 | 18 |
| Features | 10 HRV | 12 (HRV + demographics) |
| Labeling | Fixed SI=20 threshold | Per-subject median |
| Accuracy | ~95% *(misleading)* | **76.6%** |
| AUC | 0.52 *(random)* | **0.842** |
| Macro F1 | ~0.5 | **0.766** |

> **Key Insight:** Eval 1 had 97% "Stress" labels → model always predicted Stress → 95% accuracy but AUC = 0.52 (useless classifier). Per-subject median labelling in Eval 2 guaranteed class balance → AUC improved from 0.52 → **0.842**.

## 🔧 Methodology

### HRV Features (12 total)

| Domain | Feature | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Time | `mean_rr` | Mean RR interval (ms) |
| Time | `sdnn` | Standard deviation of NN intervals |
| Time | `rmssd` | Root mean square of successive differences |
| Time | `pnn50` | % of successive differences > 50 ms |
| Time | `cv` | Coefficient of variation |
| Frequency | `lf` | Low-frequency power (0.04–0.15 Hz) |
| Frequency | `hf` | High-frequency power (0.15–0.40 Hz) |
| Frequency | `lf_hf` | LF/HF ratio (sympathovagal balance) |
| Nonlinear | `sd1` | Poincaré SD1 (short-term variability) |
| Nonlinear | `sd2` | Poincaré SD2 (long-term variability) |
| Nonlinear | `si` | Baevsky Stress Index |
| Demographic | `age`, `gender_enc` | Subject demographics |

### Windowing Strategy
- **Window:** 60 beats (sliding)
- **Step:** 20 beats (66% overlap)
- **Labeling:** Per-subject median SI threshold → balanced binary Stress / Non-Stress labels

### LSTM Architecture
```
Input (60 timesteps × 12 features)
  └─► LSTM(64) + Dropout(0.3)
  └─► BatchNormalization
  └─► LSTM(32) + Dropout(0.3)
  └─► Dense(16, relu)
  └─► Dense(1, sigmoid)
```
- Optimizer: Adam | Loss: Binary Crossentropy
- Callbacks: EarlyStopping (patience=10), ReduceLROnPlateau

## 📈 Results & Findings

### Demographic HRV Findings

- **SDNN declines ~31%** from Young → Older (autonomic nervous system aging)
- **RMSSD drops ~47%** from Young → Older (reduced vagal protection)
- **LF/HF doubles** Young → Older (sympathetic dominance with age)
- **Females** show higher RMSSD and HF power (stronger vagal tone vs males)
- ANOVA confirms significant age-group differences (p < 0.05) for SDNN, RMSSD, LF/HF

### Top Stress Biomarkers (Permutation Importance)

1. **lf_hf** — sympathovagal imbalance
2. **sd1** — reduced short-term variability
3. **hf** — reduced parasympathetic tone
4. **rmssd** — reduced vagal activity
5. **sdnn** — overall HRV reduction

### ARIMA Findings

- Best order selected by AIC/BIC grid search
- Residuals pass Ljung-Box test (white noise confirmed → model well-specified)
- AR φ₁ coefficient **decreases with age** → shorter HRV memory in older adults

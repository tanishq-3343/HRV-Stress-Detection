#  Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis for Stress & Sleep Monitoring

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis** for detecting and monitoring stress and sleep conditions using RR interval data.

HRV reflects the activity of the **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)** and is widely used in:
- Stress detection systems  
- Sleep quality analysis  
- Wearable health monitoring  
- Clinical research  

The project implements data preprocessing, HRV feature extraction, machine learning classification, and performance evaluation.

##  Objectives

- Extract meaningful HRV features from RR intervals  
- Analyze autonomic nervous system behavior  
- Build a classification model for stress/sleep states  
- Evaluate performance using standard ML metrics  
- Visualize HRV patterns and results

##  HRV Features Extracted

### ⏱ Time-Domain Features
- Mean RR Interval  
- SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals)  
- RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences)  
- pNN50  

### 📊 Frequency-Domain Features
- LF (Low Frequency Power)  
- HF (High Frequency Power)  
- LF/HF Ratio  

These features indicate sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity.
